In this exercise you will map the ancient equivalent of Twitter data: the ancient inscriptions. Ancient people of class, education, and means liked to advertise their achievements and life milestones as well as their sorrows via the means of texts inscribed in stone. These epigraphic monuments were often placed near inhabited areas, roads, and gathering places where they were likely to attract the largest audience. The location of these self-expressions in space and time is a reasonable indicator of changing economic prosperity of the commissioning communities. In this exercise, you will explore how these ancient inscriptions spatially correspond to the distribution of ancient cities and settlements.

# Task 1: Load ancient cities and convert to sf object
John Hanson has created a dataset of all cities in the ancient Mediterranean and made it available online. You will download this dataset and convert it into an sf object in order to compare with the inscriptions on the basis of location.  

* Use `read_csv()` to load `Hanson2016_Cities_OxREP.csv` dataset from the provided URL and assign it to `cities` object

```{r load-cities, eval=FALSE}
cities <- as.data.frame(read_csv("http://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/oxrep/docs/Hanson2016/Hanson2016_Cities_OxREP.csv"))
```


... then reproject this data to EPSG 3035
```{r prj-cities, eval=FALSE}
# Convert the table into an sf object on the basis of X and Y columns
cities_sf <- st_as_sf(cities, coords = c("Longitude (X)", "Latitude (Y)"))
head(cities_sf)

# Define the projection of Lat/Long coordinates as EPSG 4326
cities_sf4326<- st_set_crs(cities_sf, 4326)

# Transform the projection to a 2D projection using EPSG 3035
cities_sf3035<- st_transform(cities_sf4326, 3035)

# Verify the projection is 'projected' not 'geographic'
crs(cities_sf3035) # CRS says "+proj" meaning it is projected
```


### Question 1: 
*What are the measurement units of the `cities_sf3035` object?*
Contrary to geographic projection, measurements here are not in degrees but in distance, i.e. miles or meters.

# Task 2: Create a buffer around each city and inspect the result

As each city and inscription corresponds to a dot on the map, the best way to grab and review the inscriptions will be by creating a buffer around each city point and then selecting inscriptions on the basis of that. 

* Create a buffer around the projected `cities` geometry with `st_buffer()` , setting the `dist` argument to the desired radius of 5000m.
* Plot the resulting buffer with city on top for quick review. 

```{r buff, eval=FALSE}

# Make buffer of 5 km. Check the units of your object to correctly assign value to dist
cities_5km<- st_buffer(cities_sf3035,dist = 5000)

# Plot the first 10 buffers and cities to check result 
plot(st_geometry(cities_5km)[1:10], col = "yellow") # Adding city buffer first
plot(st_geometry(cities_sf3035)[1:10], pch=20, cex = 0.1, add = TRUE) # Applying the first 10 cities on top 

```


# Task 3: Verify the city buffers are indeed 5km in radius
Well, a quick review may look ok, but you cannot be sure your buffers work well until you add them to a map with a scale. Verify that your buffers are as big as should be by plotting a sample with tmap and adding a scale of good resolution.

* Grab the first 10 cities and buffers with slice() function
* Load tmap package and plot the 10 cities and buffers with a scale of 0,10,20km. Add names and background for clarity. Do your buffers span 10km across or do they span the universe? (If the latter, recheck your CRS, units, and dist argument)

```{r tmap, eval=FALSE}
# Grab the first 10 elements in the sf object and the buffer
ten_buffers <- cities_5km %>% slice(1:10)
ten_cities <- cities_sf3035 %>% slice(1:10)

# Create a quick tmap
library(tmap)
current.mode <- tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(ten_buffers)  +
  tm_polygons(col = "forestgreen") + # Chose forestgreen as buffer color
  
  tm_shape(ten_cities) +
  tm_text("Ancient Toponym", 
          size = 0.8, # Changed size to 0.8
          auto.placement = 5) +
  
  tm_dots(col = "green", 
             size = 0.1) +
  
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 10, 20), # Correct km scale with 0,10 and 20 km distances
               text.size = 10,
               position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  
  tm_compass(position = c("left", "bottom"),
             type = "rose", 
             size = 2) +
  
  tm_credits(position = c("right", "top"),
             text = "Marie Mortensen, feb 16th 2021") + # Changed the empty space with credits to mine
  
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map with a scale",
            bg.color = "beige",
            inner.margins = c(0, 0, 0, 0))

```


If all went well, you should see a map, where the diameter of each city buffer corresponds to the 10km notch on the scale
            
# Task 4: Download ancient inscriptions and wrangle coordinates into shape 
Let's now look at some data that spatially co-occurs with these ancient places. Below is a link to an online dataset from the Epigraphic Database of Heidelberg of ancient inscriptions from one part of the ancient world. These inscriptions combine private and official expressions dedicated for personal reasons (death of a dear person) or public (dedication of a major building, placement of milestone, etc.). 

The json dataset is hefty with some 12 thousand inscriptions and 74 variables. Coordinates are nested in a single column and may need wrangling. Do tasks deliberately in small steps after you test on subsets lest you overwhelm your R.

* Download the linked file with `download.file()` where you can find it. 
* The inscriptions dataset is in `.json` format, which is becoming the dominant format for sharing data online. Use the `jsonlite::fromJSON` function in the library to load it back into R
* Next, use `as_tibble()` to convert into rectangular format.  
* Check the column names looking for something that holds spatial data. There should be a `coordinates` column. Look at the column whether it holds meaningful coordinates.
* Separate the two values inside single coordinate column and create a separate longitude and a latitude column, which contain clean decimal numbers. You will need to clean up non-numeric characters en route. Make sure to keep the decimal point. Hint: there are lots of ways of getting clean decimal coordinates into two new columns, so feel free to diverge from the suggested course. Check out the `gsub()`, `grep()` and `str_extract()` functions to implement regular expressions in tidyverse pipeline. 

```{r inscriptions, eval=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
install.packages("tidytext")
library(tidytext)

# Download the file and save as inscriptions.json (consider commenting out after you first run to avoid repeat downloading)
download.file("https://sciencedata.dk/public/b6b6afdb969d378b70929e86e58ad975/EDH_subset_2021-02-15.json", "inscriptions.json") # Last one is where you want to put it and name it as

# Load it into R from wherever you put it, and convert into a tibble
list_json <- jsonlite::fromJSON("inscriptions.json")
inscriptions = as_tibble(list_json)

# Check the first couple lines and column names
head(inscriptions) # Inspecting first lines
colnames(inscriptions) # Printing all column names

# Selecting the  coordinates column
inscriptions %>% 
  slice(1:100) %>% 
  select(coordinates)

# Okay it seems like coordinates contains two elements. Lets check that out
inscriptions$coordinates[1]

# So these are separated into two. However, as we see, they have some letters still we need to filter out.
inscriptions %>% 
  slice(1:100) %>% 
  separate(col = coordinates, into = c("longitude","latitude"), sep = ",") %>% select(longitude, latitude)

# Wrangle the coordinates into a plottable format
i_sm <- inscriptions %>% 
  slice(1:100) %>% 
  separate(col = coordinates, into = c("longitude","latitude"), sep = ",") %>% # Using str_remove_all to remove c, (, and ) in the coordinate columns
  mutate(latitude = as.numeric(str_remove_all(latitude, "[)]+")),
         longitude = as.numeric(str_remove_all(longitude, "[c(]+"))) 


# Check the result of the subset, does the location look reasonable?
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lng=i_sm$longitude,lat=i_sm$latitude)

i_sm %>% select(country)
```

Oooof. That was some serious wrangling! 

### Question 2: 
*Which part of the world are the inscriptions from?*
From inspection of the column content in the file i_sm it seems like the inscriptions stem from the Italy or Ancient Rome. At least the column 'country' only contains 'Italy' in the sliced 100 rows.

# Task 5: Convert inscriptions into an sf object
Now that the hard work is done, let's apply the wrangling to the full dataset and clean up the missing coordinates and outlier values.

* Not all coordinates are complete. Remove the rows with missing latitude or longitude
* Some incorrect points have sneaked in! Eliminate data with longitude smaller than 5 and larger than 20 degrees.
* Make the resulting `inscriptions` tibble into an sf object using the newly created and cleaned longitude and latitude column in the `coords` argument. The CRS of the data is 4326.
* Plot your data using st_geometry()

```{r insc-sf, eval=FALSE}
i <- inscriptions %>% 
  separate(col = coordinates, 
           into = c("longitude","latitude"), 
           sep = ",") %>% # Using str_remove_all to remove c, (, and ) in the coordinate columns 
  mutate(latitude = as.numeric(str_remove_all(latitude, "[)]+")),
         longitude = as.numeric(str_remove_all(longitude, "[c(]+"))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(longitude)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(latitude)) %>% 
  filter(longitude > 5 && longitude < 20)

# Checking that all NAs are removed
i[is.na(i$latitude),]

# Create a sf object
insc_sf4326 <- st_as_sf(i, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Plot
plot(st_geometry(insc_sf4326))
```

# Task 6: Select inscriptions that fall into the cities' buffer
Now that you have both the cities and inscriptions in the same CRS, you can pick the inscriptions which fall within 5km radius of the ancient places in order to locate "urban" inscriptions. Use the inverse st_difference to locate "rural" inscriptions.

To reduce the computational intensity of the final intersection, it is a good idea to limit the dissolved city buffer object only to the area within the convex hull of the inscriptions. For the convex hull, you will need to combine the inscriptions into a MULTIPOINT feature using `st_union()`. 

* Ensure that the spatial reference system in `cities_5km` buffer object and `inscriptions` is consistent.
* Create a convex hull for the inscriptions after combining them into a MULTIPOINT.
* Combine the city buffers into a single multipolygon
* Use `st_intersection()` to clip the inscriptions that fall within the buffer object and assign to `insc_urban` object
* Use `st_difference` flag to select inscriptions outside these buffers and create `insc_rural` object

```{r intersection, eval=FALSE}
# Project the sf object into EPSG3035 so it is consistent with cities and their buffers
insc_sf3035 <- st_transform(insc_sf4326, crs = 3035)

# Create a convex hull around the inscriptions's points dissolved into a MULTIPOINT
insc_ch <- st_convex_hull(st_union(insc_sf3035))

# Create a buffer from a cluster of cities that fall within the convex hull 
cities_it <- st_intersection(insc_ch, st_geometry(cities_5km)) # Using st_union to combine it into a multipoint 

# Dissolve the 399 buffers into a single MULTIPOLYGON buffer feature
c_buff <- st_union(cities_it)

# Calculate the number of inscriptions in urban and rural areas. This may take a couple seconds
insc_urban <- st_intersection(insc_sf3035, c_buff)
insc_rural <- st_difference(insc_sf3035, c_buff)

nrow(insc_urban) # 10462
nrow(insc_rural) # 1608
```

### Question 3: 
*What is the ratio of urban to rural inscriptions?*
The ratio of urban to rural is 10462:1608.
